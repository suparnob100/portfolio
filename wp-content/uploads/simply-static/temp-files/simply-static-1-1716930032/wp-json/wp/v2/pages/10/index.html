This work produced a novel physics-informed criterion that effectively determined the dimension of reduced-order models, ensuring accurate representation for both linear and nonlinear structural vibration systems.<\/p>\n<p>After completing my doctoral studies, I undertook a postdoctoral position at Clemson University where I focused on topology optimization for bandgap maximization in 2D lattice structures and purely data-driven model discovery of structural vibration systems using neural ordinary differential equations.<\/p>\n<p>In August 2023, I transitioned to the TAMIDS <strong>(Texas A&amp;M Institute of Data Science)<\/strong> Digital Twin Lab as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, working closely with Drs. Jian Tao, Jean Ragusa, and Eduardo Gildin on the reduced-order modeling of nonlinear systems.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of my research, I have earned certifications in machine learning and online teaching.
